          What is JavaScript?

          Why is it called JavaScript?

            <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The programs in this language are called scripts.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run
              automatically as the page loads.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. So it is
              light weight and faster.
            </p>
            <button class="tablinks" onclick="closeTab(event,'tab-1')">
              <b>Close</b>
            </button>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

              Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
              the server, or actually on any device that has a special program
              called the JavaScript engine.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript
              virtual machine”.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Different engines have different “codenames”. For example: 1 V8 -
              in Chrome, Opera and Edge. 2 SpiderMonkey - in Firefox. 3 There
              are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
              “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The terms above are good to remember because they are used in
              developer articles on the internet. We'll use them too. For
              instance, if a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably
              works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.

              <b>Close</b>
            </button>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

              When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
              “LiveScript”.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that
              positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would
              help.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
              with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no
              relation to Java at all.
